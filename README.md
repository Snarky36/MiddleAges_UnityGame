# MiddleAges_UnityGame
This game is about middle ages. Tha game also has interactions with npcs but the text is written in Romanian Lanugage. You can change it if you want from the Interactable.cs script. This is just a small project to learn basic animations and how you can interact with objects. <br>
The main controls are:
<br>W,A,S,D for movement. 
<br>L - for dance animation. 
<br>F - for placing a fire camp. 
<br>I- for interacting with npcs. 
<br>With left click you can press next on the text animation. 
<br>Have fun and feel free to change whatever you want and use this project for everything you want.
